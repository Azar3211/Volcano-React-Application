# Volcano Application

This applications serves as a front end implementation of information related to volcanoes. It is a 2 part with the other being an express application. This project allows the user to register and login as well as view different volcanoes around the world. Where they are located and the population density. Due to the constraint of the Swagger API being on HTTP and the site being published as HTTPS the live page cannot access the information. However, It does display the design of the project so feel free to see what it looks like. 

Otherwise run the project locally. 
# First clone the repository 
# Install Dependencies
do this by npm install
# Build the application 
npm run build
# serve locally
npm install -g serve
# then serve 
serve -s dist


Or 
# Perform npm run dev
